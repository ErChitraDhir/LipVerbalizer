LipVerbalizer aims to construct a deep learning model capable of deciphering speech from visual lip movements alone. By harnessing the power of convolutional and recurrent neural networks, we seek to bridge the communication gap for those with hearing impairments, offering a potential lifeline to a world previously inaccessible to them.
